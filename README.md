# JustinTestToken

This repository contains test smart contracts, designed to be used alongside the [ContractIntegrationGuide](https://github.com/JustinMaDev/ContractIntegrationGuide). It demonstrates how to integrate blockchain smart contracts into frontend projects.

The ethereum directory contains a Solidity project created with Hardhat. It includes a special ERC20 token, which has its minting permission open for testing purposes, allowing anyone to mint tokens.

The solana directory contains an Anchor project, which also includes a test token. This token uses metadata to set its token name, symbol, and other details.
